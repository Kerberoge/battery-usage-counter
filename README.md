# Battery Usage Counter
This program counts how many percent of your battery capacity has been used during a certain time. It also calculates how many percent per hour are consumed. All this information is written to /var/log/battery.\
An example usage of this program would be to set it so that it runs before and after suspending a laptop, in order to measure the battery usage during suspend.
